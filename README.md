This front end challenge was really challenging for me.  I don't have bunch of experience working with cypress professionally, and neither with this type of drag 
and drop user case.  Eitherway, it was exciting work with new scenarios for me, I learned a lot in the process.  
I use page object pattern on this repo, in order to organize the code.  I wished I had time to add cucumber scenarios, but figuring out the drag and drop action
took me a lot of time.  
Regarding to reports, I use mochawesome library.  You will need to run "cypress run --reporter mochawesome" in the command line in order to run the test cases and create the report of it.
